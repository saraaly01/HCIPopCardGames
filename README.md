# HCIPopCardGames

## PopCard Games is an accessible card game hub.
   The program offers the games 21 and War. The games can be played with and without voice and sound. The program uses tkinter for the GUI, and multithreading and subprocesses along with Google's text to speech and speech recognition for the voice/sound feature. 
 
## Installations
Install python (a version atleast 3.10.6 will work)
- pip install tk (tkinter) 
- pip install Pillow (requirements might be satified by previous installation but just incase)
- pip install pydealer
- pip install SpeechRecognition
- pip install gTTS
- pip install pyaudio
- pip install numpy

The mpg123 files do not need to be installed as they are already in the working directory. 

## How to run
 Install the packages from above. Once you install python you can copy this command:
 
 pip install tk Pillow pydealer SpeechRecognition gTTS numpy pyaudio

 After the repository is cloned, you only need to run the "menu.py" file (python menu.py) after moving into the "Final" directory.
